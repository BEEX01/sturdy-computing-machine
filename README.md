## Data Collection :

The dataset has been obtained from Grouplens.

## Modelling :

The following modelling approach was used in the project:

1. Loading & exploring the Movie and User ratings data
2. Creating User-Item Matrix, User-User and Item-Item similarity matrices for Movie Recommendations
3. Creating feature and applying ML models to predict the ratings for unseen movies for a user

The detailed analysis and model creation can be found in the .ipynb file. 
## Result :

Some of the test images are given below.

The results from Movie-Movie Similarity is as below:
